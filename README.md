# Implementing-Linear-Regression-Algorithm
In this project I have implemented the Linear Regression algorithm and compared it with SKlearns linear Regression algorithm with SGDClssifier.

##Comparision between Sklearn's implementation and my implementation on `boston dataset` <br> 

**SKLearns MSE** || 22.83070152994931 <br>
**Costom MSE** ||  39.25087753409695  <br>
